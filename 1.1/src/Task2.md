1.1 - Task 02

Supermarket operations are complex and involve many variables, such as customer behavior, inventory levels, and seasonal changes. 
Variability is evident, for example, in the fact that customers purchases vary by time of day and day of the week. 
Complexity comes from the fact that there are many products in different categories, and their storage and pricing require careful management. 
Interdependence means that, for example, delays in the supply chain can affect inventory levels and customer service. 

The efficiency of a supermarket therefore depends on how well these different elements work together.
