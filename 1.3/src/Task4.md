1.3 - Task 04

To simulate the age distribution of students, we can use the Normal Distribution, which is defined by the average age (mean) and the spread of ages (standard deviation). 
By generating random numbers based on this distribution, we can realistically model the age structure, with most values clustering around the mean.
