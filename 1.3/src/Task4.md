1.3 - Task 04

1. Normal Distribution
We can use the Normal Distribution to simulate the age distribution of students. It is based on the average age (mean) and how much the ages vary (standard deviation). 
Random numbers generated from this distribution will mostly cluster around the mean, making it good for modeling age structures.

2. Binomial Distribution
The Binomial Distribution shows the number of successes in a set number of trials, where each trial has the same chance of success. 
For example, this can be used to simulate how likely students are to pass or fail an exam.

3. Poisson Distribution
The Poisson Distribution models how many events happen in a set time, based on an average rate. 
For example, it can be used to simulate how many students arrive at a library in one hour.

4. Exponential Distribution
The Exponential Distribution shows the time between events in a Poisson process. For instance, it can simulate the time between students arriving at a service desk.
