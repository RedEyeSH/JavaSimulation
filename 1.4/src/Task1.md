1.4 - Task 01
A health centre’s system needs to work well for both staff and patients. 
Response time is how fast the system replies to a request, like confirming an appointment quickly. 
Throughput is the number of tasks the system can handle at once, making sure it processes patient records smoothly. 
Availability means the system should be accessible most of the time, so doctors and nurses can always use it. 
Reliability is how well the system works without breaking down, so users don’t face issues. 
Scalability is the system’s ability to handle more users if the health centre gets busier. 
Maintainability makes sure updates and fixes can be done easily without stopping the system for too long. 
A good system should balance all these factors to keep everything running smoothly.
