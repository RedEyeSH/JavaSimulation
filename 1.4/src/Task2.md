1.4 - Task 02

Performance measures are tracked and updated in different categories to keep a system working well. 
One important category is service point performance, which includes things like response time and availability. This makes sure the service is quick and reliable. 
Another category is customer experience, which focuses on how easy and smooth the system is for users. A system that is fast and works without issues improves satisfaction.
Operational efficiency is also important. It looks at how well resources are used, making sure the system can handle more users without slowing down. 
Then there’s maintenance and updates, which keep the system running by fixing bugs and improving performance. 
Finally, security and stability help protect data and make sure the system doesn’t crash.
By keeping track of these categories, systems can stay efficient, reliable, and easy to use for both service providers and customers.
