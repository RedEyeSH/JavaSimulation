1.4 - Task 05

A-phase (Initialization): This is when everything is set up. 
It’s about creating the entities (like passengers or customers), setting up queues, and getting the environment ready to start the simulation.

B-events (Main Processing): This phase is where the action happens. 
It’s about processing the entities as they move through the system—like checking in, going through security, or completing transactions. 
It updates queues and resources based on what’s happening.

C-events (Finalization): This is the end of the simulation. It’s about wrapping things up—completing any final tasks, generating reports, and cleaning up resources.
